## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. Key components include:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Experiment tracking using DVC
- Data versioning using DVC
- Deployment on AWS

## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Digvijay25/MLOps-Complete-ML-Pipeline.git
cd MLOps-Complete-ML-Pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Scripts for data collection and preprocessing are provided in the `data` directory.
2. **Model Training**: Train your model using the scripts in the `model` directory.
3. **Experiment Tracking**: Use DVC to track your experiments. See the [Experiment Tracking with DVC](#experiment-tracking-with-dvc) section for details.
4. **Data Versioning**: Version your datasets using DVC. See the [Data Versioning with DVC](#data-versioning-with-dvc) section for details.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy your model on AWS. See the [Cloud-Based Solutions with AWS](#cloud-based-solutions-with-aws) section for details.

## Experiment Tracking with DVC
DVC helps in tracking experiments efficiently. To start tracking experiments, follow these steps:
1. Initialize a DVC project:
   ```sh
   dvc init
   ```
2. Add data and models to DVC:
   ```sh
   dvc add data/
   dvc add model/
   ```
3. Commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git add data.dvc model.dvc dvc.yaml .gitignore
   git commit -m "Track data and models with DVC"
   ```

## Data Versioning with DVC
DVC allows versioning of datasets:
1. Add a remote storage for DVC:
   ```sh
   dvc remote add -d myremote s3://mybucket/path
   ```
2. Push the data to the remote storage:
   ```sh
   dvc push
   ```

## Cloud-Based Solutions with AWS
Deploy your model on AWS using the provided scripts and configurations:
1. Configure your AWS credentials:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```
2. Use AWS services such as S3 for storage and EC2 for deployment.
